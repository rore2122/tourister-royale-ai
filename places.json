    "description": "The Taj Mahal is an iconic ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the Yamuna River in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Later, Shah Jahan's own tomb was also placed there. The mausoleum is the centerpiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens. Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about US$916 million). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmed Lahori. The Taj Mahal is widely considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its recognized architectural beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave and convex and dazzling light shadow effects. The Taj Mahal is a masterpiece of symmetry and balance, with its four identical sides and the four minarets perfectly framing the central dome. Its elegance is enhanced by the intricate marble inlay work, featuring precious and semi-precious stones. It is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, attracting millions of visitors annually who come to admire its beauty and learn about its rich history. It stands as a testament to eternal love and architectural brilliance.",

Found primarily in the East Khasi Hills, particularly around Cherrapunji (Sohra) and Mawlynnong, these bridges are formed by guiding the aerial roots of the Indian rubber fig tree (Ficus elastica) across rivers and streams.

Unlike man-made structures, these bridges grow stronger with time and are remarkably durable against the region's heavy rainfall. Famous examples include the Double Decker Root Bridge in Nongriat and the single root bridge near Riwai village. Trekking to these bridges often involves navigating challenging terrains and descending hundreds of steps, but the reward is a breathtaking encounter with these natural architectural marvels.
